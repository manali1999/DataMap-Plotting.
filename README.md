# DataMap-Plotting.
Data Map Plotting This project focuses on visualizing geospatial data using Python. It leverages mapping libraries to plot and analyze spatial data points on an interactive map. The goal is to provide an intuitive and insightful representation of geographic trends, which can be useful for data analysis, location-based insights, and decision-making.

# Technologies Used 🛠
Python 

Folium – For interactive map visualization

Pandas – For data cleaning and processing

GeoPandas – For handling geospatial datasets

Matplotlib/Seaborn – For additional data visualization
# Installation & Setup
Install Required Libraries

pip install pandas folium geopandas matplotlib seaborn

Run the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook

Open Data_Map_Plotting.ipynb and execute the cells to generate the interactive map.

# Usage Instructions 🚀
Load your geospatial dataset (CSV, JSON, or Shapefile).

Process the data using Pandas/GeoPandas.

Generate an interactive map with markers for each location.

Customize the visualization (e.g., change marker colors, add pop-ups, layer multiple maps).


# Example Output 📌
✅ Interactive map with plotted locations

✅ Heatmaps and cluster markers for high-density areas

✅ Geographic insights on business, travel, or environmental data
